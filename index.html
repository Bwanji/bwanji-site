                    <h2>Digital Church</h2>
                    <byline>By Larry Mwansa</byline>
                    <p>What makes a Digital-Only Church? Simply put, it utilizes digital tools to create a church in
                        existing digital communities. The intent of a Digital-Only Church is not to launch in physical
                        space, but to utilize digital tools to reach, engage, encourage, and disciple people to be the
                        church digitally and physically. </p>

                    <p> The idea is not to “do” church in a building but to BE the church wherever God takes you. A
                        Digital-Only Church is not a virtual building where people meet, but a digital distribution
                        network allowing the Gospel to spread. This is where technology, relationships and
                        disciple-making converge towards creating a movement of God, digitally.</p>

                    <p>This is about empowering people to use digital tools to to connect, engage and disciple. Think of
                        it this way it like an outreach strategy but instead of your neighbourhood or your city, we
                        doing this is digital and metaverse spaces.
                    <p>

                    <p>We work with churches and individuals to o create micro-networks within the organization. Through
                        these micro-networks, participants will be grouped into similar approaches:
                    <p>

                    <p>- Digital Churches (Social Media Churches, Streamer Churches)
                        - Metaverse Churches
                        - Physical Churches doing Digital Ministry

                        Redefining Power
                        Power has changed. The old model of “power” thrives on control.
                        Nothing kills a movement like control.

                        The new model of “power” is less about control, and much more about Empowering.
                        Equipping.
                        Platforming.
                        Releasing.
                        This is how today’s movements happe.
